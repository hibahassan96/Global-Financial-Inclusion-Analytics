# Global Financial Inclusion Analytics
**Project Motivation:**
This project analyzed global adoption and resistance to financial services using the World Bank's Global Findex Database 2021. By examining detailed data on banking, mobile wallets, and digital payments, along with demographic information, the goal was to identify key trends and barriers to financial inclusion across different regions.

**Methodology:**
- **Data Cleaning:** Streamlined the dataset by removing irrelevant columns and handling missing values through mode imputation to ensure data accuracy.
- **Data Importing and Initial Analysis:** Imported the cleaned data into R and performed initial analyses to explore variables such as country, region, gender, age, education, income, and financial service usage.
- **Detailed Analysis:** Conducted comprehensive analysis on demographics, regional internet and mobile phone access, and the use of various financial services. Utilized the `likert` package in R to create visualizations, such as bar charts, to effectively display the distribution of Likert scale responses regarding financial service adoption.

**Results and Recommendations:**
- **Findings:** Identified that younger adults (18-40 years) are the primary users of financial services. Noted significant regional variations in internet and mobile access, with high-income regions having better connectivity. Found barriers to financial service adoption, including documentation challenges, distrust in financial institutions, and perceived high costs.
- **Recommendations:** Enhance financial inclusivity by improving internet and mobile access in underserved regions. Address adoption barriers with educational campaigns and simplified documentation processes. Promote mobile payments and digital wallets to reach unbanked populations.
